Fun Twitter bot that adds some fun frogs to your feed!

I made this bot for fun over the summer when messing around with the Twitter API and just general python tools. Give it a follow to add some fun frog content to your twitter feed. It posts two frog pictures a day at 10:30am and 3:30pm. I am hosting it myself on a raspberry pi zero with crontab. 

I do not claim ownership of any of the frog pictures.
